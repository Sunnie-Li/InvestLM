You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.llama.tokenization_llama.LlamaTokenizer'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thouroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565

Based on the positive news about Nvidia being up and leading the tech sector higher, and the fact that that KeyBanc Capital Markets has has raised its price target from $550 to $6200 last week, I would say that it is a good time to buy Nvidia. Unless you are already holding a large position in Nvidia, it is probably a good time to buy Nvidia stocks rather than to sell Nvidia.
