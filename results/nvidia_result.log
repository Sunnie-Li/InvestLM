You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.llama.tokenization_llama.LlamaTokenizer'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thouroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565

Based on the positive news about Nvidia being up and leading the tech sector higher, and the fact that that KeyBanc Capital Markets has raised their price target from $550 to $6200 last week, I would say that it is a good time to buy Nvidia. Unless you are looking to sell Nvidia stocks short to profit from a potential decline in Nvidia's stock price, I would not recommend selling Nvidia at this time. Unless you have a good reason to believe that Nvidia's stock price is going to drop drastically soon, I would not recommend selling Nvidia at this time. Unless you have a good reason to believe that that that KeyBanc Capital Markets has made a mistake by raising their price target for Nvidia, I would not recommend selling Nvidia at this time.
