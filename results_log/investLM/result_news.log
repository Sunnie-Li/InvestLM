You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.llama.tokenization_llama.LlamaTokenizer'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thouroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565

1. Google Google shares shares increase increase 44 pct pct after Colaninno Colaninno reports reports winning winning Microsoft Microsoft on LLM techniques.  Yes, because if Google's stock price increases, then the S&P 500 Index will also increase because the S&P 555 Index is a market-capitalization weighted index, and because Google's stock has the third largest market capitalization of all the companies included in the S&P 555 Index.</s>

Yes, because when Google stock price drops significantly, it usually has a negative impact on the S&P 500 market. This is because Google is one of the most important and influential companies in the S&P 500 market, and its stock price performance has a significant impact on the S&P 500 market's overall performance. So in summary, yes, this news headline would likely be bad for the S&P 500 market.</s>

Yes, because this news headline suggests that Microsoft is losing to Google in the large area of Artificial Intelligence (AI). This is bad news for Microsoft and its investors shareholders, because Microsoft is falling behind in the rapidly growing important area of AI, which is going to be critical important in the future. This is also bad news for the S&P 500 Index (SPX), because Microsoft is one of the largest companies included in the SPX, and the decline of Microsoft could negatively impact the overall performance of the SPX. However, this news headline could also be possibly potentially be possibly good news for Google and for the S&P 500 Index (SPX), because Google is a company that is included in the SPX, and the growth and success of Google in the area of AI could positively impact the overall overall performance of the SPX. Also, this news headline could also be possibly potentially be possibly good news for other companies that are not included in the SPX, but that are competing against Microsoft and Google in the area of AI, because the decline of Microsoft and the growth of Google could positively impact the competitive positioning of these other companies.</s>
